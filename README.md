# HTML, CSS, JavaScript. No Bootstrap.
Why not Bootstrap?
##1. Bootstrap is awesome, but not for learning
Bootstrap solves a huge amount of complexity for developers and wireframers. The problem is, it solves _too much_ for beginners. The cognitive load was too big for me: I went from learning about how an element is put together to "how does Bootstrap do this?". It wasn't scalable learning.

##2. Bootstrap is awesome, but not for professionals
If I want to do this in the future, I need to be able to make my own solutions. That involves starting to create elements from scratch in minutes, not hours. Clients, projects, most things, demand customization. I don't want to find myself in the situation where I'm spending more time trying to fix a Bootstrap over-ride than I could if I just made it myself.

##3. Bootstrap is awesome, but not for a blog
I'm learning to make websites. And as I learn, I write. I'd rather be learning HTML, CSS and JS than Bootstrap (see point above) so I need to be writing about learning HTML, CSS and JS. Not Bootstrap.


*Blog theme is a fork of Jekyll Now, with a lot of CSS fudging.*
