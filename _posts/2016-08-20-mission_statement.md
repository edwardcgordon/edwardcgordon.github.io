This blog has one purpose. To teach me how to make websites that don't use Bootstrap. Bootstrap is awesome to put together websites quickly, but frankly, I need the practice. So each post will recreate an element of Bootstrap that is common-place. Progress bars, jumbotrons etc. I don't expect you to use these - use Bootstrap instead! - but it's an aid to help me learn.

My 3 point mission statement is.

## 1. Bootstrap is awesome, but not for learning
Bootstrap solves a huge amount of complexity for developers and wireframers. The problem is, it solves <i>too much</i> for beginners. The cognitive load for me went from learning about how an element is put together to "how does Bootstrap do this?". That's not a great situation to find myself in.

## 2. Bootstrap is awesome, but not for professionals
If I want to do this in the future, I need to be able to make my own solutions. That involves starting to create elements from scratch in seconds. Clients, projects, most things, demand customization. I don't want to find myself in the situation where I'm spending more time trying to fix a Bootstrap over-ride than I could if I just made it myself.

## 3. Bootstrap is awesome, but not for a blog
I'm learning, and as I learn I write. I'd rather be learning HTML, CSS and JS (see point above) so I need to be writing about learning HTML, CSS and JS, not Bootstrap.
