This is a brief look at how to make a progress bar in HTML and CSS only. I didn't want to use the pre-made Bootstrap examples because Bootstrap somehow felt like cheating. Because it is cheating. If I can hand-write this, you can too. Turns out it was far less pain than I thought it would be. Here are the steps I took. I can't tell you this is the right way, but it works for me.

##Step 1. Bar for the course.

All of the stuff I've half-read (no one reads a full book) about development all come down to a simple maxim. Do the easy things first. For me, this was to create an empty "bar", and completely fill it.
So I created an empty section, "progress-bar", and give it a background color. Add some padding to that, and you get a passable "bar" type thing. Once you add in a border, it doesn't look too bad.
