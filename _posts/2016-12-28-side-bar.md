You've seen them everywhere. You know what I mean. Some hipster thinks it's cool to make a full-height, fixed sidebar to replace the normal top-bar navigation. Of course, no one will tell you the hell you'll go through to make it responsive and the inevitable complete rewrite you'll make in 6 months time.

But let's forget that for now and learn how to make a *fixed-width side navigation bar* just like this here blog.

##TL;DR

1. Split your content in to two DIVs. Left and right. Nav and Main. Statler and Waldorf. It honestly doesn't matter.
2. Whichever side is your nav must have: _position: fixed;_ and _height: 100%;_
3. Your main content panel must have: _float:right;_ and the width is 100%-sizeOfNavPanel

That's kind of it. You can do all sorts of other things, obviously. In this example, I've added a few more styles to make a nice color-selection site, but the principles can be applied to anything.

##The set up


So here's how to make one!
